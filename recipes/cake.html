            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter three 8-inch round cake pans.</li>
                    <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter on low speed until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down sides.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add in lightly beated eggs, beating between each addition, scraping down the sides as needed.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. With mixer on low speed, alternately add flour to the batter.</li>
                    <li>Divide batter evenly among the pans. Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer layers to wire racks and let cool for 15 minutes. Turn out cakes, and return to racks, tops up, until completely cool.</li>
                    <li>Place one cake layer on a serving platter; spread 1 1/2 cups frosting over the top. Add the second cake layer, and spread with another 1 1/2 cups frosting. Top with third cake layer. Cover outside of cake with 3 cups of the frosting.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with chocolate chips and top with optional topics of your choice.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
