This project requires a website to me created with multiple links to different recipes, each pages containing 
information on the recipe, instructions on how to prepare it, and an image of the finished product.

This task will require using lists, images, and anchors, as well as understanding how all of these pieces fit
together to form a cohesive webpage.
